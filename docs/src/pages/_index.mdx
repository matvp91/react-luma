Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components and render
them in a WebGL canvas. React Luma started out as an optimized renderer for TV's, set-top boxes and other low memory devices.

# Installation

```js
npm install react-luma
```

React Luma's API is very familiar to anyone who has worked with
React DOM. The main difference is that you can no longer rely on DOM
elements such as a div or span, but you'd be building your UI
composition with the built-in base components.

# Playground

Feel free to make changes to the code below and the compiler will
render an immediate result.
