Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components and render
them in a WebGL canvas. React Luma started out as an optimized renderer for TV's, set-top boxes and other low memory devices. Dive into [the documentation here](./docs) and start exploring.

- **Layout engine** included, allows you to build flexible layouts in no time.
- Build your UI **declaratively** with _re-usable_, self-contained components that react to state.
- Comes with **spatial navigation** logic built in.
- _Will ship with an animations toolkit soon_

# Installation

<Admonition type="warning" title="A kind reminder">
  React Luma is in experimental stage, more documentation to follow as it
  becomes more stable.
</Admonition>

```js
npm install react-luma
```

React Luma's API is very familiar to anyone who has worked with
React DOM. The main difference is that you can no longer rely on DOM
elements such as a div or span, but you'd be building your UI
composition with the built-in base components.

# Playground

Feel free to make changes to the code below and the compiler will
render an immediate result.
